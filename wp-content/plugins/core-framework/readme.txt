Say hello to Core Framework - a FREE modular CSS framework platform.

== Description ==
Hey there! If you're tinkering with WordPress and have a knack for making sites look just right, you might like what we've cooked up with Core Framework. It's like a Swiss Army knife for your CSS woes but way easier to use and with a lot more fun involved.

## What's Cooking?
✅ **Make It Yours**: Ever felt boxed in by CSS frameworks? We get it. That’s why we made Core Framework as customizable as a build-your-own pizza. You start with our base (which is pretty awesome on its own), and then add, tweak, or remove anything you don’t need. It’s all about making it fit your project like a glove.

✅ **Play Well with Others**: Whether you’re team Gutenberg, all about Bricks, or an Oxygen fan, we’ve got your back. Core Framework slides right into your workflow, making it that much smoother to sprinkle your design magic everywhere.

✅ **A Dash of This, A Dash of That**: Organize your colors, manage those borders, and set your typography scale just right. We’re all about making the tedious tasks a piece of cake, so you can focus on the fun parts of design.

✅ **Components Galore**: Reusable components are your best friends. Buttons, input styles, cards - you name it, we help you keep it all neat and tidy, ready to be reused whenever you need them.

✅ **Join the Club**: With over 4,000 buddies already in the Core Framework family, you’re in good company. Our [marketplace](https://coreframework.com/marketplace) is like a treasure chest of our ecosystem, full of add-ons, UI kits, and templates. Plus, you’re more than welcome to contribute as an author!
